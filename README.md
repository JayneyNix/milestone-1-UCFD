# Samantha Harris Professional Make-Up Artist
Samantha Harris is a local business owner who provides professional make-up services for weddings and sprecial events across the Greater Toronto Area. Previously she has relied on Instagram and FaceBook to share images of her work and reach new clients but these channels don't convey the quality of her brand which is essentially herself and her professional experience.


Samantha needed to have a professional web presence to showcase her work and get across a feeling for the type of artist she is. The value of the website to her will be proven by the amount of additional bookings she receives.


For the end-user, the website will demonstrate the sort of artist she is, allow them to browse her past work for inspiration and validate whether they want to book an initial consultation or trial. It should be easy for the user to get in touch with Samantha through a range of methods as the target market is mainly younger female and tech-savvy. 


## Features




### Features Left to Implement
There is the potential for the website to grow in functionality as the business grows and requires it to. Additional features that could be implemented in the future are;
1. An FAQ page to cover the process, duration and how best to prepare.
2. A booking system with calendar for clients' to book a trial session online.
3. Embed an Instagram feed for new client photos so that visitors to the site can always see up-to-date images without the site being updated every day with them.
4. Add in a blog page where the client can post regularly about the make-up industry, trends and news and therefore position herself as an authority.
5. Ability to 'share' the gallery images so that if clients want to share something they like via email or social channels they can easily do this.
