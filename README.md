# Samantha Harris Professional Make-Up Artist
Samantha Harris is a local business owner who provides professional make-up services for weddings and sprecial events across the Greater Toronto Area. Previously she has relied on Instagram and FaceBook to share images of her work and reach new clients but these channels don't convey the quality of her brand which is essentially herself and her professional experience.


Samantha needed to have a professional web presence to showcase her work and get across a feeling for the type of artist she is. The value of the website to her will be proven by the amount of additional bookings she receives.


For the end-user, the website will demonstrate the sort of artist she is, allow them to browse her past work for inspiration and validate whether they want to book an initial consultation or trial. It should be easy for the user to get in touch with Samantha through a range of methods as the target market is mainly younger female and tech-savvy.

Wireframes are available in the master repository - 


## Features
Visitors to the site can find out information about the make-up artist and get an undestanding of the type of work she does. They are also able to browse images and find a price list for the services offered and then ultimately they can contact the website owner with a question or to make a booking and this can be achieved either by calling or filling out and submitting the contact form or by navigating to one of the social media channels where they can send her a message.


### Features Left to Implement
There is the potential for the website to grow in functionality as the business grows and requires it to. Additional features that could be implemented in the future are;
1. An FAQ page to cover the process, duration and how best to prepare.
2. A booking system with calendar for clients' to book a trial session online.
3. Embed an Instagram feed for new client photos so that visitors to the site can always see up-to-date images without the site being updated every day with them.
4. Add in a blog page where the client can post regularly about the make-up industry, trends and news and therefore position herself as an authority.
5. Ability to 'share' the gallery images so that if clients want to share something they like via email or social channels they can easily do this.


# Technologies Used
The technolgies used in this project were;
1. Bootstrap - I used this framework in order to achieve consistency across the project and also for efficiency of build and ease of layout using grid system. Script used can be found here - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/.
2. jQuery and Popper.js were required technologies for certain Bootstrap elements employed such as the Navbar and Carousel functions. Script used can be found here - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/.
3. Google Fonts - Used to implement my chosen font of 'QuickSand' to fit the look and feel of the site. I got the link from this site and adapted for my font - https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started.
4. FontAwesome - Used to easily utiize icons for contact methods and social media which are easily recognizable to the user. Script for FontAwesome icons here - https://fontawesome.com. 

# Testing
Project was tested on all major devices using DevTools. Functioning was also tested on the following major browsers;

- Firefox


- Google Chrome


- Internet Explorer


- Safari


All links on each html file were tested on above devices and browsers and implementation of 'mobile-first' tested so that everything functioned as anticipated for example the 'testimonial' carousels do not appear in 'extra-small' and 'small' browser views.


I used the html code validator https://validator.w3.org in order to verify validity of code and used some code for Bootstrap FlexBox and the table on the services.html page from the BootStrap website, however I customized the code as necessary.


# Deployment
I deployed the site using GitHub by;
1. Going to my repository milestone-1-UCFD and navigating to 'Settings'.
2. Go to GitHub Pages and 'source' drop-down menu and selecting 'master' as the publishing source.
